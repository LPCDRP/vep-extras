# NAME

vep-extras - extra utilities for manipulating variant effect predictor annotations

# DESCRIPTION

Our **vep-extras** is a collection of scripts for operations on Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) annotation files that are expected to be available as part of VEP itself.
These scripts are developed for internal use so, despite attempts at generality, they may not be adequate for general needs.
*Use these programs at your own risk.*

It currently contains the following programs:

vep-filter-impact
:	position-based filter for VEP annotations

vepretty
:	pretty-print VEP results files
